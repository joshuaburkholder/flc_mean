      <p>our worship service follows a centuries-old pattern (aka “the liturgy”) that is based in Scripture and includes prayers, songs, and call-and-response exchanges with the worship leader</p>
      <p>We’d love for you experience our liturgy in person and join us in worship! We gather every Sunday at 9:30 a.m. for about an hour or so. </p>
